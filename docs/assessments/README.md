## 🔍 Assessment Process

### 📝 **How to Use These Assessments**

1. **For New Development**
   - Use assessments as quality benchmarks
   - Follow patterns from Tier 1 components
   - Ensure all new code meets enterprise standards

2. **For Migration Planning**
   - Review legacy assessments to understand current state
   - Prioritize components with lowest scores
   - Use enterprise assessments as target architecture

3. **For Code Reviews**
   - Reference assessment criteria for consistent evaluation
   - Ensure compliance with enterprise patterns
   - Validate implementation against established benchmarks
